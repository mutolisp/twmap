}
\arguments{
\item{theme}{An integer (1, 2, or 3) selecting the color theme for the elevation data:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{1:} Terrain Colors (Default).
  \item \strong{2:} Greens/Oranges with transparency.
  \item \strong{3:} Grayscale.
}}

\item{lwd}{Numeric. The default line width for boundaries and grids.}

\description{
Generates a map of Taiwan displaying Digital Terrain Model (DTM) 
(using preloaded data c0-c8), river networks, and the island boundary.

This function plots the Taiwan map using pre-processed elevation classification
data (c0-c8) and boundary data (twbound), which are stored as sf objects.
It uses Base R graphics for plotting.
