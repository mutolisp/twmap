\title{Draw Taiwan Map with Elevation and Optional River Data}
\usage{
draw.twmap(theme, lwd, draw_river = TRUE, draw_grid_lines = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{theme}{An integer (1, 2, 3, or 4) selecting the color theme for the map:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{1:} Terrain Colors (Default).
  \item \strong{2:} Greens/Oranges with transparency.
  \item \strong{3:} Grayscale.
  \item \strong{4:} Black/White Border only (No elevation fill).
}}

\item{lwd}{Numeric. The default line width for boundaries and grids.}

\item{draw_river}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), the river lines from the \code{river} dataset are drawn (only for theme 1-3).}

\item{draw_grid_lines}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), longitudinal and latitudinal grid lines are drawn.}
}
\value{
The function is used for its side effect (plotting the map) and returns \code{NULL} invisibly.
}
\description{
This function plots the Taiwan map using pre-processed elevation classification
data (c0-c8) and boundary data (twbound), which are stored as sf objects.
It uses Base R graphics for plotting.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Example 1: Default Terrain Colors with all elements
draw.twmap(theme = 1, lwd = 1)

# Example 2: DTM map, no rivers, show grid lines
draw.twmap(theme = 3, draw_river = FALSE, draw_grid_lines = TRUE)

# Example 3: Black/White Border Only (Minimal map)
draw.twmap(theme = 4, lwd = 1, draw_river = FALSE, draw_grid_lines = FALSE)
}
